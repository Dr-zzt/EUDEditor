</p>

EUD Editor 2 SE is a fork of the official [EUD Editor 2](https://github.com/armoha/EUDEditor) program. It aims to improve the user experience and workflow for creators who still prefer EE 2 to the newer and more frequently updated [EUD Editor 3](https://github.com/Buizz/EUD-Editor-3) program.
